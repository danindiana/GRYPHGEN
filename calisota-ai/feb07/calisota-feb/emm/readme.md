Mathis Pink 1 Qinyuan Wu 1 Vy Ai Vo 2 Javier Turek 3 Jianing Mu 4 Alexander Huth 4 Mariya Toneva 1

This is a position paper that argues for the importance of incorporating episodic memory into Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable efficient long-term operation. Here's a succinct summary of the paper:

**Main Argument:**
To fully realize the potential of LLMs as agentic systems, they need to be equipped with episodic memory, which allows for continuous learning and long-term knowledge retention.

**Key Properties of Episodic Memory for LLMs:**

1. **Long-term Storage**: Store knowledge across any number of tokens.
2. **Explicit Reasoning**: Reflect and reason about stored information.
3. **Single-shot Learning**: Rapidly encode unique experiences from single exposures.
4. **Instance-specific Memories**: Capture details unique to a particular occurrence.
5. **Contextualized Memories**: Bind context to memory content (e.g., when, where, why).

**Current Research Directions:**

1. **In-Context Memory**: Extending context window, but faces challenges in length generalization and computational cost.
2. **External Memory**: Augmenting LLMs with separate memory modules, but often lacks contextual details and single-shot learning capabilities.
3. **Parametric Memory**: Updating LLM parameters for specific domains or tasks, but has limitations in single-shot learning and contextualization.

**Episodic Memory as a Unifying Framework:**
The paper proposes that enabling episodic memory can combine and extend existing methods to advance LLM agents' capabilities. A general architecture is presented, with four main research directions:

1. **Encoding**: Store information from in-context memory in an external memory store.
2. **Retrieval**: Select relevant past episodes for retrieval and reinstatement into in-context memory.
3. **Consolidation**: Periodically consolidate external memory contents into the LLM's base parameters.
4. **Benchmarks**: Develop new tasks and metrics to assess episodic memory in LLM agents.

**Research Questions:**

1. How to store information from in-context memory in an external memory store?
2. How to segment continuous input into discrete episodes for storage?
3. How to select relevant past episodes for retrieval and reinstatement?
4. How can long-context advances improve external memory retrieval and reinstatement?
5. How to consolidate external memory contents without forgetting previous knowledge?
6. What new benchmarks are needed to assess episodic memory in LLM agents?

**Alternative Views:**
The paper acknowledges two alternative perspectives:

1. **Scaling In-Context Memory**: Might be sufficient, but is speculative and may incur prohibitive computational costs.
2. **Contextualized External Memory**: May not fully address the need for episodic memory, as it still requires forgetting mechanisms and incurs high storage costs.

**Conclusion:**
The paper argues that incorporating episodic memory into LLMs is crucial for efficient long-term operation. By outlining a roadmap of research questions, the authors aim to spark a community-wide shift in how we conceive and engineer long-term memory in AI systems.
