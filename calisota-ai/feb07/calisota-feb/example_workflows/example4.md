```
Coding Challenge Failure: The operator notices the system is unable to solve a coding challenge.

Problem Descriptors: The system gathers relevant information about the failure, including error messages, logs, and importantly, the sandbox shell history.  This context is crucial for the frontier model.

API Call to Frontier Model: The system makes an API call to a frontier model (like GPT-4), including the problem descriptors and the code as part of the prompt. This prompt provides the frontier model with the context it needs to provide useful assistance.

Frontier Model Assistance: The frontier model analyzes the information and provides code suggestions, guidance, or even code completion.

Code Integration & Refinement: The system integrates the frontier model's suggestions into the code and refines it.

Code Re-execution: The refined code is executed in the sandbox.

Solution Submitted/Feedback: If the code succeeds, the solution is submitted. If it fails, a report is sent to the operator, and the process can iterate.

Feedback & Iteration: The operator can provide feedback, which triggers another attempt with the LLM and code generator, potentially incorporating further guidance from the frontier model.

Clearer Subgraphs and Styling:  The diagram uses subgraphs and styling for better organization and readability.

This example demonstrates how the system can leverage frontier models for complex tasks like coding challenges. The crucial aspect is the inclusion of detailed problem descriptors, including sandbox history, in the prompt to the frontier model. This allows the frontier model to provide more targeted and effective assistance. The iterative feedback loop enables the system to refine its approach based on both the execution results and operator feedback.
