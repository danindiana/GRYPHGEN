To explore Perl pipes modules for your use case involving inter-process communication and message passing on Ubuntu 22.04, we'll look into some Perl modules that are suitable for this task. Here are a few recommended modules and a brief overview of how you might use them:

### 1. **IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3**
These modules allow you to open a process for both reading and writing.

**Usage example:**

```perl
use IPC::Open2;

my $pid = open2(\*READER, \*WRITER, 'llama.cpp');
print WRITER "input data\n";
while (<READER>) {
    print "Output: $_";
}
close(READER);
close(WRITER);
```

### 2. **IO::Pipe**
This module provides an object-oriented interface for creating pipe handles.

**Usage example:**

```perl
use IO::Pipe;

my $pipe = IO::Pipe->new();
if (my $pid = fork()) {
    # Parent process
    $pipe->reader();
    while (<$pipe>) {
        print "Child output: $_";
    }
    waitpid($pid, 0);
} else {
    # Child process
    $pipe->writer();
    exec('ollama');
}
```

### 3. **IPC::Run**
This module allows running and interacting with child processes.

**Usage example:**

```perl
use IPC::Run qw(run start pump finish);

my @cmd = ('llama.cpp');
my $in = "input data\n";
my $out;
run \@cmd, \$in, \$out;
print "Output: $out";
```

### 4. **Parallel::ForkManager**
For managing multiple processes in parallel.

**Usage example:**

```perl
use Parallel::ForkManager;

my $pm = Parallel::ForkManager->new(2);

for my $process (qw/llama.cpp ollama/) {
    $pm->start and next;
    exec($process);
    $pm->finish;
}

$pm->wait_all_children;
```

### Integration with `nvidia-smi`
To integrate with `nvidia-smi` and monitor GPU usage while managing the services, you can periodically check the status using backticks or system calls.

**Usage example:**

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $gpu_info = `nvidia-smi`;
print "GPU Info: $gpu_info\n";

# Example of starting and communicating with services
my $pid = open2(\*READER, \*WRITER, 'llama.cpp');
print WRITER "input data\n";
while (<READER>) {
    print "Output: $_";
}
close(READER);
close(WRITER);
```

These modules should provide a robust framework for handling inter-process communication in your system. You can mix and match these examples based on your specific requirements and the nature of the processes you are managing.
