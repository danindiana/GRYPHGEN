See: https://metacpan.org/dist/JSON-Parse

To install the `JSON::Parse` module for Perl, you can use the `cpan` or `cpanm` command-line tools. Here are the steps to install `JSON::Parse` using both methods:

### Using `cpan`

1. **Open a Terminal**: Launch your terminal application.

2. **Install `JSON::Parse`**: Run the following command to install the module:

   ```bash
   cpan JSON::Parse
   ```

   You may be prompted to configure CPAN the first time you run it. Follow the prompts to complete the configuration.

### Using `cpanm`

1. **Install `cpanm`**: If you don't already have `cpanm` installed, you can install it using the following command:

   ```bash
   cpan App::cpanminus
   ```

2. **Install `JSON::Parse`**: Once `cpanm` is installed, you can use it to install `JSON::Parse` with the following command:

   ```bash
   cpanm JSON::Parse
   ```

### Verification

After the installation is complete, you can verify that `JSON::Parse` is installed by running a simple Perl script:

```perl
use JSON::Parse;
print "JSON::Parse is installed\n";
```

Save this script to a file (e.g., `test_json_parse.pl`) and run it:

```bash
perl test_json_parse.pl
```

If the output is "JSON::Parse is installed", then the module is successfully installed and ready to use.

### Troubleshooting

- **Permissions**: If you encounter permission issues, you may need to run the `cpan` or `cpanm` commands with `sudo` (e.g., `sudo cpan JSON::Parse` or `sudo cpanm JSON::Parse`).
- **Network Issues**: Ensure that your system has access to the internet, as `cpan` and `cpanm` need to download the module from the CPAN repository.

By following these steps, you should be able to install `JSON::Parse` for your Perl instance.

To detect the version of Perl you are using and gather other useful information about your Perl installation, you can use several methods. Here are some common approaches:

### Using the `perl` Command

1. **Check Perl Version**:
   Run the following command in your terminal to display the version of Perl you are using:

   ```bash
   perl -v
   ```

   This will output something like:

   ```
   This is perl 5, version 32, subversion 1 (v5.32.1) built for darwin-thread-multi-2level
   ```

2. **Display Configuration**:
   To display detailed configuration information about your Perl installation, run:

   ```bash
   perl -V
   ```

   This will output a large amount of information, including the configuration settings, installed modules, and more.

### Using a Perl Script

You can also use a simple Perl script to gather information about your Perl installation:

```perl
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

# Display Perl version
print "Perl Version: $]\n";

# Display Perl configuration
print "Perl Configuration:\n";
foreach my $config (qw(
    archname
    bincompat5005
    byteorder
    cc
    ccflags
    gccversion
    ld
    lddlflags
    ldflags
    libc
    libperl
    osname
    osvers
    usemymalloc
    version
)) {
    print "$config: " . ($^O eq 'MSWin32' ? $Config{$config} : `perl -MConfig -e "print \\$Config{$config}"`) . "\n";
}
```

Save this script to a file (e.g., `perl_info.pl`) and run it:

```bash
perl perl_info.pl
```

This script will output the Perl version and various configuration details.

### Using the `perldoc` Command

You can use the `perldoc` command to display documentation about Perl, including version information:

```bash
perldoc perl
```

This will display the Perl documentation, which includes information about the version and other details.

### Summary

- **Perl Version**: Use `perl -v` to check the version.
- **Perl Configuration**: Use `perl -V` to display detailed configuration information.
- **Perl Script**: Create a Perl script to gather and display specific information.
- **Perldoc**: Use `perldoc perl` to access the Perl documentation.

By using these methods, you can easily detect the version of Perl you are using and gather other useful information about your Perl installation.
