### Step-by-Step Guide to Granting Local Models Access to a Virtual Machine Environment Using LM Studio

#### Step 1: Install and Set Up LM Studio

1. **Download and Install LM Studio:**
   - Go to [LM Studio's official website](https://lmstudio.ai) and download the installer.
   - Follow the installation instructions to set up LM Studio on your machine.

2. **Download and Load a Model:**
   - Open LM Studio.
   - Search for and download an LLM, such as TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF.
   - Navigate to the "Local Server" tab (indicated by the `<->` icon on the left).
   - Select the downloaded model from the dropdown and click the green "Start Server" button to start the server.

#### Step 2: Set Up the Virtual Machine

1. **Install VirtualBox or VMware:**
   - Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/).
   - Download the Ubuntu ISO from the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

2. **Create and Configure the VM:**
   - Create a new VM in VirtualBox/VMware.
   - Allocate resources (e.g., 8 GB RAM, 4 CPU cores) and install Ubuntu.
   - Install SSH on the VM:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openssh-server
     sudo systemctl enable ssh
     sudo systemctl start ssh
     ```

3. **Set Up Port Forwarding:**
   - In VirtualBox, go to the VM settings, navigate to the "Network" section, and set up port forwarding (e.g., Host Port 2222 to Guest Port 22).
   - In VMware, navigate to "Network Adapter" -> "Advanced" and configure port forwarding similarly.

#### Step 3: Set Up SSH Access from Host to VM

1. **Test SSH Access:**
   - From your host machine, use SSH to connect to the VM:
     ```bash
     ssh -p 2222 your-username@localhost
     ```

#### Step 4: Integrate LM Studio with the VM via SSH

1. **Install Required Python Libraries:**
   - On the VM, install Python and required libraries:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3-pip
     pip3 install paramiko requests
     ```

2. **Create a Script to Forward LM Studio Requests to the VM:**
   - Create a Python script on your host machine to handle the communication:

   ```python
   import paramiko
   import requests
   import json

   def execute_command_on_vm(command):
       host = "localhost"
       port = 2222
       username = "your-username"
       password = "your-password"

       ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
       ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
       ssh.connect(host, port, username, password)

       stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(command)
       output = stdout.read().decode()
       ssh.close()
       return output

   def lm_studio_request(prompt):
       url = "http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions"
       headers = {
           "Content-Type": "application/json"
       }
       data = {
           "messages": [
               {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful coding assistant."},
               {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
           ],
           "temperature": 0.7,
           "max_tokens": 150,
           "stream": False
       }
       response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
       return response.json()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       prompt = "How do I init and update a git submodule?"
       lm_response = lm_studio_request(prompt)
       command = lm_response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
       vm_output = execute_command_on_vm(command)
       print("Command Output:", vm_output)
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script from your host machine to test the integration:
     ```bash
     python3 your_script.py
     ```

This setup allows your local quantized language model in LM Studio to execute tasks on a VM running Ubuntu through a bash command line environment using SSH. You can modify the script to handle different types of commands and responses as needed.


Based on the setup you've shared, it looks like your LM Studio server is running correctly. Now, let's integrate it with a virtual machine (VM) environment to execute commands via SSH. 

### Integrate LM Studio with the VM via SSH

#### Step 1: Install Required Libraries on Host Machine

1. **Install Required Python Libraries:**
   - Install `paramiko` and `requests` on your host machine:
     ```bash
     pip install paramiko requests
     ```

#### Step 2: Create a Python Script to Forward LM Studio Requests to the VM

1. **Create the Script:**

   ```python
   import paramiko
   import requests
   import json

   def execute_command_on_vm(command):
       host = "localhost"
       port = 2222
       username = "your-username"
       password = "your-password"

       ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
       ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
       ssh.connect(host, port, username, password)

       stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command(command)
       output = stdout.read().decode()
       ssh.close()
       return output

   def lm_studio_request(prompt):
       url = "http://localhost:2234/v1/chat/completions"
       headers = {
           "Content-Type": "application/json"
       }
       data = {
           "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF",
           "messages": [
               {"role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes."},
               {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
           ],
           "temperature": 0.7,
           "max_tokens": -1,
           "stream": True
       }
       response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
       response_data = response.json()
       return response_data

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       prompt = "Introduce yourself."
       lm_response = lm_studio_request(prompt)
       print("LM Studio Response:", lm_response)

       # Extract the command from the response, if applicable
       if "choices" in lm_response:
           command = lm_response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
           vm_output = execute_command_on_vm(command)
           print("Command Output:", vm_output)
   ```

#### Step 3: Run the Script

1. **Execute the script from your host machine:**

   ```bash
   python3 your_script.py
   ```

This script sends a request to your LM Studio server running locally, gets the response, and forwards any extracted command to be executed on the VM via SSH. Ensure you have the correct SSH credentials and that your VM is properly configured for SSH access.

### Additional Configuration (Optional)

If the language model output isn't directly executable as a command or needs parsing, you'll need to add parsing logic in the script to handle different responses and commands.

### Troubleshooting

- **SSH Connection Issues:** Ensure your VM is running and accessible via SSH. Test the connection manually using:
  ```bash
  ssh -p 2222 your-username@localhost
  ```

- **LM Studio Server Issues:** Ensure your LM Studio server is running and accepting requests by testing the endpoints manually:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:2234/v1/models
  curl http://localhost:2234/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "model": "lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF", "messages": [ { "role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes." }, { "role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself." } ], "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": -1, "stream": true }'
  ```

With this setup, your local quantized language model running in LM Studio can access and execute commands on a VM running Ubuntu through a bash command line environment using SSH.
