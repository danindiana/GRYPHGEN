# GRYPHGEN
Grid Resource Prioritization in Heterogeneous Environments

GRYPHGEN uses LLMs to automate the production of software at scale, developed by Calisota.ai. It aims to optimize resource utilization and improve the efficiency of grid computing systems.

The framework consists of several components:

1. SYMORQ: Systems Orchestration for Resource Quality, is an LLM-based orchestration OS that uses ZeroMQ message passing API. It is responsible for managing and coordinating the resources in the grid.

2. SYMORG: Systems Orchestration Retrieval Generator, is an LLM automated RAG constructor. It helps in generating and retrieving resource allocation and scheduling information.

3. SYMAUG: Smart Yielding Microservices for Agile and Ultra-Portable Grids, is a dockerized or virtual machine implementation of the CCDE-SIOS ensemble. It provides a lightweight and portable solution for grid computing.

Overall, GRYPHGEN aims to improve the efficiency and resource utilization of grid computing systems by providing a smart and intelligent framework for resource optimization.

Gryphgen utilizes a series of interconnected sequence diagrams to describe its operation. These diagrams illustrate the various stages of the process, including task submission and initialization, code generation and analysis, task monitoring and workflow optimization, continuous deployment and monitoring, and adaptive learning and system evolution. By breaking down the workflow into these distinct stages, the diagrams provide a comprehensive understanding of how Gryphgen functions.
