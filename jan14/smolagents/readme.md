bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-venv
python3 -m venv smolagents-env
source smolagents-env/bin/activate
pip install smolagents
Initialize an Agent: Begin by creating an agent powered by a language model. You can choose from various models, such as HfApiModel, which leverages Hugging Face's Inference API. Here's an example of initializing a CodeAgent with a specific model:

python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel

model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"
model = HfApiModel(model_id=model_id, token="<YOUR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN>")
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[], model=model, add_base_tools=True)
In this setup, add_base_tools=True includes default tools like a Python code interpreter and DuckDuckGo web search. 
HUGGING FACE

Run the Agent: With the agent initialized, you can execute tasks. For example, to calculate the 118th Fibonacci number:

python
Copy code
agent.run("Could you give me the 118th number in the Fibonacci sequence?")
The agent will generate and execute the necessary code to provide the answer. 
HUGGING FACE

Customize Tools: Enhance your agent's capabilities by adding custom tools. Define a tool using the @tool decorator:

python
Copy code
from smolagents import tool

@tool
def model_download_tool(task: str) -> str:
    """
    Returns the most downloaded model for a given task from the Hugging Face Hub.
    Args:
        task: The task for which to get the most downloaded model.
    """
    from huggingface_hub import list_models
    most_downloaded_model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downloads", direction=-1)))
    return most_downloaded_model.id
After defining the tool, include it in your agent:

python
Copy code
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[model_download_tool], model=model)
This setup allows the agent to utilize the model_download_tool for relevant tasks. 
HUGGING FACE

Inspect Agent Runs: After execution, review the agent's performance using:

python
Copy code
# Access detailed logs
logs = agent.logs

# Generate a high-level summary
agent.write_inner_memory_from_logs()
These tools help in understanding the agent's decision-making process and identifying areas for improvement. 
HUGGING FACE

By following these steps, you can set up and customize smolagents on your Ubuntu Linux desktop, enabling the development of efficient, model-driven agents tailored to your specific needs.

ChatGPT
To effectively utilize smolagents on your Ubuntu Linux desktop, it's essential to understand how to create and manage tools within the framework. Here's a concise guide to get you started:

Define a Custom Tool: In smolagents, a tool is a function that an LLM can use within an agentic system. To create a custom tool, you can use the @tool decorator provided by smolagents. This decorator allows you to define a function with metadata that helps the LLM understand how to use it. Here's an example of defining a tool that returns the most downloaded model for a given task from the Hugging Face Hub:

python
Copy code
from smolagents import tool
from huggingface_hub import list_models

@tool
def model_download_tool(task: str) -> str:
    """
    This is a tool that returns the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub.
    It returns the name of the checkpoint.
    Args:
        task: The task for which to get the download count.
    """
    most_downloaded_model = next(iter(list_models(filter=task, sort="downloads", direction=-1)))
    return most_downloaded_model.id
In this function, the @tool decorator is used to define model_download_tool as a tool that can be utilized by an agent. The function takes a task name as input and returns the ID of the most downloaded model for that task from the Hugging Face Hub. 
HUGGING FACE

Share Your Tool to the Hub: Once you've defined a custom tool, you can share it to the Hugging Face Hub for others to use. This is done by calling the push_to_hub() method on the tool. Ensure you've created a repository for it on the Hub and are using a token with write access.

python
Copy code
model_download_tool.push_to_hub("{your_username}/hf-model-downloads", token="<YOUR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN>")
Replace {your_username} with your Hugging Face username and provide your API token. This will upload your tool to the specified repository on the Hugging Face Hub. 
HUGGING FACE

Import a Space as a Tool: You can directly import a Space from the Hugging Face Hub as a tool using the Tool.from_space() method. This allows you to leverage existing Spaces as tools within your agent. For example, to import an image generation Space:

python
Copy code
from smolagents import Tool

image_generation_tool = Tool.from_space(
    space_id="black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell",
    name="image_generator",
    description="Generate an image from a prompt"
)
This creates a tool named image_generator that can generate images based on prompts by utilizing the specified Space. 
HUGGING FACE

Use LangChain Tools: smolagents supports integration with LangChain tools. To import a tool from LangChain, use the Tool.from_langchain() method. For instance, to use a web search tool from LangChain:

python
Copy code
from langchain.agents import load_tools
from smolagents import Tool

search_tool = Tool.from_langchain(load_tools(["serpapi"])[0])
This imports the SerpAPI web search tool from LangChain, which can then be used within your agent. 
HUGGING FACE

Manage Your Agent’s Toolbox: You can manage an agent’s toolbox by adding or replacing tools. To add a new tool to an existing agent:

python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel

model = HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[], model=model, add_base_tools=True)
agent.toolbox.add_tool(model_download_tool)
This adds the model_download_tool to the agent's toolbox, allowing the agent to utilize this tool during its operations. 
HUGGING FACE

Use a Collection of Tools: smolagents allows you to leverage tool collections by using the ToolCollection object. You can load all tools from a collection and add them to your agent’s toolbox:

python
Copy code
from smolagents import ToolCollection, CodeAgent, HfApiModel

image_tool_collection = ToolCollection(
    collection_slug="huggingface-tools/diffusion-tools-6630bb19a942c2306a2cdb6f",
    token="<YOUR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN>"
)
model = HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[*image_tool_collection.tools], model=model, add_base_tools=True)
This loads all tools from the specified collection and adds them to the agent, enhancing its capabilities. 
HUGGING FACE

By following these steps, you can define, share, and manage tools within smolagents on your Ubuntu Linux desktop, enabling the development of efficient, model-driven agents tailored to your specific needs.

OK. So what does this stack look like with some real world examples. Assume I've gotten everything setup (and I'm running local models using ollama vs an API). Explain how the human operator enters a request and how the system executes on that request.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Integrating smolagents with locally hosted models via Ollama on your Ubuntu Linux desktop enables efficient execution of complex tasks without relying on external APIs. Here's how the system operates from user input to task completion:

Human Operator Input:

The operator provides a natural language request, such as: "Generate a summary of the latest research on quantum computing."
Agent Initialization:

A CodeAgent is initialized using smolagents, configured to utilize a local model through Ollama.
The agent is equipped with necessary tools, including web search capabilities and code execution environments.
python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, LiteLLMModel, DuckDuckGoSearchTool

model = LiteLLMModel(model_id="ollama_chat/llama3.2:3b", api_key="ollama")
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[search_tool], model=model, add_base_tools=True)
This setup ensures the agent can process the request using the specified local model and tools.

Request Processing:

The agent receives the operator's request and determines the necessary steps to fulfill it.
For the given example, the agent might decide to:
Search for recent publications on quantum computing.
Summarize the findings.
Tool Utilization:

The agent employs the DuckDuckGoSearchTool to gather relevant information:

python
Copy code
search_results = search_tool.run("latest research on quantum computing")
It then processes these results to extract key points.

Local Model Execution:

Utilizing the local Llama model via Ollama, the agent generates a concise summary:

python
Copy code
summary = model.generate(f"Summarize the following research findings: {search_results}")
Response Delivery:

The agent compiles the summary and presents it to the human operator in a clear and concise format.
This workflow demonstrates how smolagents, combined with local models through Ollama, can autonomously handle complex tasks based on human input, ensuring efficient and secure processing without dependence on external services.

How would that work if for example the human user wanted the agent to "scan for nginx instances on all networked devices and output the results in the console."? 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To fulfill the request to "scan for nginx instances on all networked devices and output the results in the console," the agent would execute the following steps:

Network Scanning:

Objective: Identify active devices on the local network.

Method: Utilize ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests to detect live hosts.

Implementation:

The agent sends ARP requests to the network's IP range to discover active devices.
Tools like Scapy can facilitate this process.
python
Copy code
from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp

def scan_network(ip_range):
    arp_request = ARP(pdst=ip_range)
    broadcast = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
    packet = broadcast / arp_request
    result = srp(packet, timeout=3, verbose=0)[0]
    devices = [{'ip': received.psrc, 'mac': received.hwsrc} for sent, received in result]
    return devices
This script scans the specified IP range and returns a list of active devices with their IP and MAC addresses. 
PYTHON CODE TUTORIALS

Port Scanning:

Objective: Check for open ports associated with nginx (commonly port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS).

Method: Attempt to establish a connection to these ports on each active device.

Implementation:

The agent iterates over the list of active devices and tries to connect to ports 80 and 443.
If a connection is successful, the port is considered open.
python
Copy code
import socket

def scan_ports(ip, ports):
    open_ports = []
    for port in ports:
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
            sock.settimeout(1)
            result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))
            if result == 0:
                open_ports.append(port)
    return open_ports
This function checks specified ports on a given IP address and returns a list of open ports.

Service Detection:

Objective: Determine if the open ports are running nginx services.

Method: Send HTTP requests to the open ports and analyze the response headers for indications of nginx.

Implementation:

The agent sends an HTTP GET request to each open port.
It examines the 'Server' header in the response to check for 'nginx'.
python
Copy code
import requests

def detect_nginx(ip, port):
    try:
        response = requests.get(f'http://{ip}:{port}', timeout=2)
        server_header = response.headers.get('Server', '')
        if 'nginx' in server_header.lower():
            return True
    except requests.RequestException:
        pass
    return False
This function attempts to detect if nginx is running on a specified IP and port by checking the 'Server' header in the HTTP response.

Result Compilation and Output:

Objective: Compile the findings and display them in the console.

Method: Aggregate the data and print a summary of devices running nginx.

Implementation:

The agent aggregates the IP addresses and ports where nginx is detected.
It prints the results in a readable format.
python
Copy code
def main():
    ip_range = '192.168.1.0/24'  # Adjust this to your network's IP range
    devices = scan_network(ip_range)
    nginx_hosts = []

    for device in devices:
        ip = device['ip']
        open_ports = scan_ports(ip, [80, 443])
        for port in open_ports:
            if detect_nginx(ip, port):
                nginx_hosts.append({'ip': ip, 'port': port})

    if nginx_hosts:
        print("Nginx instances found:")
        for host in nginx_hosts:
            print(f"IP: {host['ip']}, Port: {host['port']}")
    else:
        print("No nginx instances found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This script coordinates the scanning process and outputs the results, indicating which devices are running nginx on the network.

Considerations:

Permissions: Ensure the agent has the necessary network permissions to perform scanning operations.
Network Policies: Be aware of and comply with network policies and regulations to avoid unauthorized scanning.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage unresponsive devices or network issues gracefully.
By following these steps, the agent can effectively scan the network for devices running nginx and display the results in the console.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To enhance the agent's ability to "scan for nginx instances on all networked devices and output the results in the console," we can refactor the previous implementation by encapsulating the scanning functionalities into well-defined tools. This approach aligns with best practices for building effective agents, as outlined in the Building Good Agents guide.

1. Define Custom Tools:

Network Scanner Tool:

This tool scans the local network to identify active devices.

python
Copy code
from smolagents import tool
from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp

@tool
def network_scanner(ip_range: str) -> list:
    """
    Scans the network for active devices within the specified IP range.

    Args:
        ip_range: The IP range to scan, e.g., '192.168.1.0/24'.

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries containing 'ip' and 'mac' addresses of active devices.
    """
    arp_request = ARP(pdst=ip_range)
    broadcast = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
    packet = broadcast / arp_request
    result = srp(packet, timeout=3, verbose=0)[0]
    devices = [{'ip': received.psrc, 'mac': received.hwsrc} for sent, received in result]
    return devices
Port Scanner Tool:

This tool checks specified ports on a given IP address to determine if they are open.

python
Copy code
import socket

@tool
def port_scanner(ip: str, ports: list) -> list:
    """
    Scans specified ports on a given IP address to identify open ports.

    Args:
        ip: The target IP address.
        ports: A list of port numbers to scan.

    Returns:
        A list of open ports.
    """
    open_ports = []
    for port in ports:
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
            sock.settimeout(1)
            result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))
            if result == 0:
                open_ports.append(port)
    return open_ports
Nginx Detection Tool:

This tool determines whether an nginx service is running on a specified IP and port by analyzing the 'Server' header in the HTTP response.

python
Copy code
import requests

@tool
def nginx_detector(ip: str, port: int) -> bool:
    """
    Detects if nginx is running on the specified IP and port.

    Args:
        ip: The target IP address.
        port: The target port number.

    Returns:
        True if nginx is detected; False otherwise.
    """
    try:
        response = requests.get(f'http://{ip}:{port}', timeout=2)
        server_header = response.headers.get('Server', '')
        if 'nginx' in server_header.lower():
            return True
    except requests.RequestException:
        pass
    return False
2. Initialize the Agent with Tools:

We create a CodeAgent and provide it with the custom tools defined above, along with a suitable language model.

python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel

model = HfApiModel(model_id="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", token="<YOUR_HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN>")
agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[network_scanner, port_scanner, nginx_detector],
    model=model,
    add_base_tools=True
)
3. Execute the Task:

The human operator can now instruct the agent to perform the scan. The agent will utilize the provided tools to complete the task.

python
Copy code
task_description = """
Scan the network for nginx instances and output the results in the console.
1. Use the 'network_scanner' tool to identify active devices within the IP range '192.168.1.0/24'.
2. For each active device, use the 'port_scanner' tool to check if ports 80 and 443 are open.
3. If either port is open, use the 'nginx_detector' tool to determine if nginx is running on that port.
4. Output the IP addresses and ports where nginx is detected.
"""

agent.run(task_description)
Considerations:

Simplify Workflow: By encapsulating functionalities into specific tools, we reduce the complexity of the agent's workflow, minimizing potential errors and improving maintainability. 
HUGGING FACE

Enhance Information Flow: Providing detailed descriptions and clear input/output specifications for each tool ensures that the language model has sufficient context to execute tasks effectively. 
HUGGING FACE

Error Handling and Logging: Implementing logging within each tool aids in debugging and allows the agent to handle exceptions gracefully, enhancing robustness. 
HUGGING FACE

By following this structured approach, the agent becomes more efficient and reliable in scanning for nginx instances across networked devices, adhering to best practices for building effective agentic systems.

You said:
So I have to know how to 'compose' these agents according to hugging face's rubric?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, to effectively use smolagents (or similar frameworks), you need to understand how to compose agents. This composition involves creating a structured setup where:

Tools are Defined: You break down functionalities into modular and reusable tools. Each tool has a clear purpose, inputs, and outputs, making it easy for the agent to invoke them when necessary.

Agent is Configured: The agent is initialized with the tools, a language model (e.g., local model via Ollama or Hugging Face-hosted models), and optional base tools like code execution or web search.

Instructions are Provided: The human operator communicates tasks to the agent in natural language. The agent then plans how to use the tools based on its understanding of the instructions.

Execution and Monitoring: The agent executes the task using the tools, logs its operations, and provides feedback or results.

Key Aspects of Composition (According to Hugging Face's Rubric)
Tool Modularity:

Why: Modular tools make the agent flexible and reusable across different tasks.
How: Each tool should perform a single, well-defined function and be decorated with the @tool decorator.
Example:

python
Copy code
@tool
def my_tool(data: str) -> str:
    """Processes data and returns results."""
    return data.upper()
Clarity in Task Descriptions:

Why: Clear instructions improve the agent's ability to generate accurate and efficient plans.
How: Be explicit about the task's goals, inputs, and expected outputs.
Example:

python
Copy code
task_description = """
Scan the network and find devices running nginx:
1. Use the network scanner to identify active devices in '192.168.1.0/24'.
2. Check open ports 80 and 443 on each device.
3. Verify if nginx is running on open ports.
"""
agent.run(task_description)
Model Integration:

Why: The agent relies on a language model for reasoning and decision-making.
How: Use a compatible model that fits your computational resources and privacy preferences (e.g., local Llama models via Ollama).
Example:

python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, LiteLLMModel

model = LiteLLMModel(model_id="ollama/llama2-13b")
agent = CodeAgent(model=model, tools=[my_tool], add_base_tools=True)
Toolchain Logging and Debugging:

Why: Logs help track the agent's actions and identify errors or inefficiencies.
How: Include logging mechanisms in each tool and review the agent's logs post-execution.
Example:

python
Copy code
agent.run("Perform the task and log actions.")
print(agent.logs)
Why Composition Matters
The Hugging Face framework emphasizes that agents should:

Be flexible and extensible (add or remove tools as needed).
Have clear and understandable operations (for both developers and users).
Be robust and able to handle errors gracefully.
By learning how to compose agents effectively, you gain the ability to tailor their behavior to your specific needs, whether that’s scanning networks, analyzing data, or automating workflows. Over time, you can create sophisticated agents capable of handling increasingly complex tasks.






You said:
Can all of this be run from a single machine, i.e. local hardware or do we have to rely on some kind of hf API endpoints, etc.?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can run everything entirely on a single machine using local hardware without relying on external APIs or endpoints like Hugging Face's hosted models. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Use Local Models
Why: Running models locally eliminates the need for internet-dependent APIs and provides greater control over data privacy.
How: Use frameworks like Ollama, Hugging Face's Transformers, or text-generation-webui to load and serve local models.
Example with Ollama:
python
Copy code
from smolagents import LiteLLMModel

model = LiteLLMModel(model_id="ollama/llama2-13b")  # Local model
Example with Transformers:
bash
Copy code
pip install transformers
python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

local_model = pipeline("text-generation", model="EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B", device=0)  # Adjust model as needed
2. Replace Networked Tools with Local Alternatives
Tools like web search can be replaced with locally cached or offline alternatives.
For example:
Replace DuckDuckGoSearchTool with local database queries.
Use local file scanning or document search for tasks instead of external APIs.
3. Use Open-Source Scanning and Networking Tools
Network tools (like Scapy for ARP scanning, or Python's socket library for port scanning) work entirely on your local network.
Example for network scanning:
python
Copy code
from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp

def local_network_scan(ip_range):
    arp_request = ARP(pdst=ip_range)
    broadcast = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
    packet = broadcast / arp_request
    result = srp(packet, timeout=3, verbose=0)[0]
    return [{"ip": recv.psrc, "mac": recv.hwsrc} for _, recv in result]
4. Local Execution Environment
Use local Python or shell interpreters for code execution tools.
Example for adding a Python execution tool to your agent:
python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent

agent = CodeAgent(tools=[], add_base_tools=True)  # Includes local Python code interpreter
5. Configure a Local Database for Logs or Results
Instead of sending logs or outputs to remote endpoints, store them locally using:
SQLite for structured data.
Local text files for plain logs.
Visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly for graphical representation.
6. Avoid API Dependencies
Do not include tools or models that require external APIs (like Hugging Face's hosted HfApiModel).
Stick to local alternatives for NLP, such as:
Local embeddings: Use Faiss for semantic search on embeddings generated by local models.
Local clustering: Use RAPIDS cuML or scikit-learn for clustering tasks.
7. Example Full Local Workflow
Imagine an agent scanning the network and summarizing its findings, all locally:

Code:
python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, tool

@tool
def network_scanner(ip_range: str) -> list:
    """Scan local network for devices."""
    from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp
    arp_request = ARP(pdst=ip_range)
    broadcast = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
    packet = broadcast / arp_request
    result = srp(packet, timeout=3, verbose=0)[0]
    return [{"ip": recv.psrc, "mac": recv.hwsrc} for _, recv in result]

@tool
def port_scanner(ip: str) -> list:
    """Scan for open ports."""
    import socket
    open_ports = []
    for port in [80, 443]:
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
            sock.settimeout(1)
            result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))
            if result == 0:
                open_ports.append(port)
    return open_ports

local_agent = CodeAgent(tools=[network_scanner, port_scanner], add_base_tools=True)

task = """
Scan the network for devices running nginx:
1. Use network_scanner with '192.168.1.0/24'.
2. Use port_scanner on each device.
3. Output IPs and ports where nginx is running.
"""

local_agent.run(task)
Conclusion
You can run smolagents entirely on local hardware by:

Using local models like those served by Ollama or Hugging Face Transformers.
Avoiding API-reliant tools and replacing them with local alternatives.
Leveraging local databases and computation resources for task execution and logging.
This ensures maximum privacy, control, and independence from external services.

So from nose to tail how would you describe how the library functions for someone such as myself who is working from the linux bash shell?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here's a nose-to-tail description of how the Hugging Face smolagents library functions for someone working primarily in the Linux bash shell:

1. Setup and Installation
Objective: Get the library and its dependencies installed.
Steps:
Ensure Python is installed (preferably Python 3.8+).
bash
Copy code
python3 --version
Install smolagents via pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install smolagents
Optional: Create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv smolagents-env
source smolagents-env/bin/activate
2. Creating an Agent
Objective: Define an agent that uses tools and a language model to perform tasks.
Steps:
Write a Python script to initialize the agent.
Define tools as modular functions using the @tool decorator.
Initialize the agent with tools and a language model.
Example Python Script (my_agent.py):
python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, tool
from transformers import pipeline

# Tool: A network scanner
@tool
def network_scanner(ip_range: str) -> list:
    """Scans the local network for devices."""
    from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp
    arp_request = ARP(pdst=ip_range)
    broadcast = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
    packet = broadcast / arp_request
    result = srp(packet, timeout=3, verbose=0)[0]
    return [{"ip": recv.psrc, "mac": recv.hwsrc} for _, recv in result]

# Load a local Hugging Face model
model = pipeline("text-generation", model="EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B", device=0)

# Create an agent with the tool
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[network_scanner], model=model, add_base_tools=True)

# Task to execute
task_description = "Scan the network 192.168.1.0/24 for active devices."
agent.run(task_description)
3. Running the Agent
Objective: Execute the agent script from the bash shell.
Steps:
Make the script executable.
bash
Copy code
chmod +x my_agent.py
Run the script.
bash
Copy code
./my_agent.py
The agent will process the task and execute it using the defined tools. Outputs (e.g., scanned IPs) will be displayed in the console.

4. Logging and Debugging
Objective: Review what the agent did and debug any issues.

Steps:

Check the agent's logs for a detailed account of actions taken.
Modify the script to include log review:
python
Copy code
print("Execution logs:")
print(agent.logs)
Run the modified script:

bash
Copy code
./my_agent.py
5. Extending the Agent
Objective: Add more tools and capabilities.
Steps:
Define additional tools for the agent, such as port scanning or service detection.
Add these tools to the agent's toolbox in the script.
Example:
python
Copy code
@tool
def port_scanner(ip: str) -> list:
    """Scan ports on a given IP address."""
    import socket
    open_ports = []
    for port in [80, 443]:
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
            sock.settimeout(1)
            if sock.connect_ex((ip, port)) == 0:
                open_ports.append(port)
    return open_ports

agent = CodeAgent(tools=[network_scanner, port_scanner], model=model, add_base_tools=True)
6. Automating via Bash
Objective: Automate agent tasks or chain them with other bash operations.
Steps:
Create a bash script to call the Python agent and process its output.
Example Bash Script (run_agent.sh):
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# Run the agent
python3 my_agent.py > output.txt

# Process the output
echo "Results from the agent:"
cat output.txt
Make the bash script executable:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x run_agent.sh
Run it:
bash
Copy code
./run_agent.sh
7. Key Features for Shell Users
Flexibility: You can chain the Python-based smolagents workflow with traditional Linux tools (e.g., grep, awk, sed) for additional processing.
Offline Capabilities: Run local models and tools without needing external internet connections.
Extensibility: Easily add new tools or adapt existing ones to suit your needs.
8. Real-World Example Workflow
Task:
"Scan my local network for devices running nginx and save the results to a file."

Workflow:
Define network_scanner and port_scanner tools in my_agent.py.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python3 my_agent.py > nginx_results.txt
Check results:
bash
Copy code
cat nginx_results.txt
Summary
The smolagents library acts as a bridge between tools (e.g., network scanners, local NLP models) and your Linux bash workflows.
You define agents in Python, execute them from the shell, and integrate their outputs with other tools or scripts.
This approach is modular, customizable, and well-suited for users comfortable with the Linux environment.





You said:
So the human operator has to have an idea of what tools to use, how to specify them, and what is likely to work/not work in that event?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, the human operator needs to have a basic understanding of:

What Tools Are Available:

The operator should know which tools are defined and available for use by the agent. For instance, if the task involves scanning a network, tools like network_scanner and port_scanner must already exist.
How to Specify Tools:

Tasks need to be described clearly and in a structured manner that aligns with the tools' capabilities. For example:
python
Copy code
task = """
Scan the 192.168.1.0/24 network for active devices.
Use 'network_scanner' for IP discovery.
Use 'port_scanner' to check ports 80 and 443.
"""
agent.run(task)
What is Likely to Work/Not Work:

The operator should have a sense of the agent's limitations, such as:
Tool constraints: A tool like network_scanner might not work on subnets outside the operator's current network without adjustments.
Environment requirements: Some tools may need elevated permissions (e.g., root access for ARP scans).
Model limitations: A smaller local model might not handle complex multi-step instructions as well as a larger, cloud-hosted one.
Why Is This Knowledge Important?
The smolagents library is designed to empower agents to plan tasks autonomously, but it still relies heavily on:

Tool definition: You must provide tools that are relevant to the tasks you want the agent to perform.
Task clarity: Ambiguous instructions can confuse the agent, resulting in incorrect tool usage or unexpected behaviors.
Example:
If you ask:

"Find out what's running on all devices in my network."

Without additional context, the agent might:

Fail to identify which tool to use (e.g., network_scanner or port_scanner).
Misinterpret "what's running" (services, open ports, etc.).
Instead, provide structured instructions:
"1. Use 'network_scanner' to find devices in 192.168.1.0/24.
2. Use 'port_scanner' to check ports 80 and 443 on each device.
3. Return devices running services on these ports."

Strategies to Mitigate the Need for Expertise
While operators need some knowledge, you can design the system to make it more user-friendly:

Predefine Toolchains:

Create task-specific tools or workflows that abstract complexity.
Example: Bundle network scanning into a single tool:
```
python
Copy code
@tool
def full_network_scan(ip_range: str) -> list:
    """Scans the network and identifies devices running nginx."""
    devices = network_scanner(ip_range)
    results = []
    for device in devices:
        open_ports = port_scanner(device['ip'])
        for port in open_ports:
            if nginx_detector(device['ip'], port):
                results.append({'ip': device['ip'], 'port': port})
    return results
```
Guide Task Formulation:

Provide templates or examples for common tasks so the operator doesn’t need to guess how to phrase instructions.
Error Handling:

Build fallback mechanisms into tools to provide informative error messages.
Example: If network_scanner fails due to permission issues, inform the user:
python
Copy code
raise PermissionError("Run this script with elevated privileges to scan the network.")
Use Default Tools:

Equip the agent with base tools for common operations (e.g., file handling, web scraping).
This ensures basic functionality even if the operator doesn't define custom tools.
The Human-Agent Relationship
The operator doesn't need to be an expert in every tool but should:

Understand what the tools do at a high level.
Provide clear, structured instructions.
Be aware of environmental or operational constraints.
By predefining robust tools and workflows, you can minimize the technical expertise required for the human operator while still allowing for flexibility and powerful automation.


So what is the advantage here? Lightweight library sure but if the human operator has to figure out how to describe the tools, rather than the agents figuring that out for themselves...? Also how is multi-step reasoning accomplished in this framework? How is task-planning and execution implemented also. How manual is this for a human operator to scale? Is there a way to improve on these features? If so list them.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The smolagents library offers advantages like modularity, lightweight design, and simplicity, but your points about manual effort, tool specification, and scalability are valid critiques. Here’s an analysis of the advantages, limitations, and possible improvements.

Advantages of the smolagents Framework
Lightweight Design:

Minimal dependencies, making it easy to set up and deploy.
Well-suited for local workflows and environments with constrained resources.
Flexibility:

Customizable tools for specific tasks.
Works with local models, cloud APIs, or hybrid setups.
Transparency:

Operators have direct control over tool behavior, which can improve reliability in tightly constrained scenarios.
Integration:

Compatible with Hugging Face's ecosystem, allowing easy access to pre-trained models.
Key Limitations
Manual Specification:

The human operator must predefine tools and task descriptions, which requires significant forethought and technical understanding.
Ambiguity in tasks can lead to failures or unexpected behaviors.
Limited Autonomy:

Agents rely on predefined tools rather than dynamically adapting to tasks or inferring missing information.
Multi-step reasoning and planning are not deeply integrated by default.
Scalability Challenges:

Scaling to large, complex workflows (e.g., chaining multiple agents or tools) requires manual coordination.
Lack of built-in task orchestration makes scaling tedious.
Multi-Step Reasoning:

While possible, it depends on the model's ability to interpret task descriptions and reason about tool usage step by step.
How Multi-Step Reasoning and Task Planning Are Implemented
Multi-Step Reasoning:
Achieved through the agent's ability to:
Interpret the task description.
Choose tools and invoke them in the correct sequence.
Example:
python
Copy code
task = """
Step 1: Use 'network_scanner' to identify active devices in 192.168.1.0/24.
Step 2: Use 'port_scanner' to check ports 80 and 443 on each device.
Step 3: Identify devices running nginx using 'nginx_detector'.
"""
agent.run(task)
Task Planning:
The agent uses the task description to infer a high-level plan and selects tools accordingly.
Task decomposition depends on the language model's capability (local or API).
How Manual Is This for Scaling?
Scaling requires manual effort to:

Predefine and maintain a growing set of tools.
Ensure task descriptions are well-structured for increasingly complex workflows.
Monitor and debug tasks, especially when tools or tasks fail.
Ways to Improve These Features
1. Dynamic Tool Discovery
Current: Tools are predefined by the operator.
Improvement: Allow agents to discover tools dynamically based on task descriptions or context.
Example: A metadata registry of tools that the agent can query when needed.
2. Automated Task Decomposition
Current: Task descriptions must be explicit and structured by the operator.
Improvement: Integrate task decomposition into the agent's workflow.
Use larger models or fine-tune for step-by-step task breakdown.
Example:
python
Copy code
task = "Scan the network and find nginx instances."
# Agent generates:
# 1. Scan for devices.
# 2. Check open ports.
# 3. Identify nginx instances.
agent.run(task)
3. Multi-Agent Orchestration
Current: Single-agent focus.
Improvement: Enable orchestration of multiple agents with a controller agent to handle task delegation.
Example: A "planner" agent breaks tasks into subtasks and delegates them to specialized agents.
4. Enhanced Context Management
Current: Context across multi-step tasks is limited to model reasoning.
Improvement: Build a persistent memory module to track task state, results, and logs.
Example: Store intermediate results for reuse in subsequent steps.
5. Predefined Task Templates
Current: Operators must define tasks manually.
Improvement: Provide task templates or wizards for common workflows.
Example: A prebuilt template for network scanning tasks.
6. Improved Scalability
Current: Scaling requires manual effort to add tools and manage workflows.
Improvement: Introduce tool versioning, dynamic loading, and dependency management to simplify scaling.
7. Incorporate Feedback Loops
Current: No feedback mechanism to learn from failed tasks.
Improvement: Add a feedback mechanism where the agent learns to refine task execution based on operator input.
Final Thoughts
The smolagents library is designed for simplicity and modularity, but it requires manual effort for tool specification, task description, and scaling. By introducing dynamic tool discovery, automated task decomposition, and multi-agent orchestration, its usability and scalability can be significantly enhanced.

These improvements would reduce the cognitive load on human operators and make the library better suited for larger, more autonomous workflows.

```
OK give me the smoothbrain version of how this all works. I'm going to go get some groceries and then maybe revisit this after I've taken a break. How powerful is this system, how viable is it for someone with my knowledge and resources to work with in your estimation?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s the smoothbrain version of how smolagents works:

What smolagents Does
Think of smolagents as a way to build a "robot assistant" (agent) that can:

Use Tools: Like a Swiss Army knife, you give it tools to do specific tasks (e.g., scan a network, check open ports, summarize text).
Follow Instructions: You tell it what to do in plain language, and it figures out which tools to use and in what order.
How It Works
You Define the Tools:

These are simple functions in Python, like:
scan_network() to find devices.
check_ports() to see what's open.
summarize_text() to make a summary.
You Set Up the Agent:

Combine the tools with a language model (a small brain) like LLaMA or GPT (can be local or cloud-based).
The agent reads your instructions and decides how to use the tools.
You Give It Tasks:

Example: “Scan the network and tell me if any devices are running nginx.”
The agent:
Finds devices (scan_network()).
Checks their ports (check_ports()).
Looks for nginx (check_nginx()).
Outputs results.
How Powerful Is It?
Very Flexible: You can customize tools to do almost anything Python can handle.
Lightweight: Works locally without needing fancy cloud services.
Limited Autonomy: It’s not fully independent. You still need to:
Define the tools.
Write clear instructions.
Fix things when it breaks.
How Viable Is It for You?
Your Knowledge (Based on What I Know):
You’re experienced with Linux, Python, and working at a fairly technical level. That’s a huge plus because:
You already know how to write scripts and work with terminal tools.
You understand how to set up and troubleshoot things like network scanning.
Your Resources:
Hardware: You have a solid setup (e.g., Ryzen CPU, RTX GPUs, plenty of RAM). This is more than enough to run smolagents and even decent-sized local models.
Time: If you’re willing to put in some effort to define tools and test workflows, you can make smolagents work for your needs.
Should You Use It?
If you like full control, smolagents is great because you build everything yourself.
If you want plug-and-play AI, it might feel like too much work compared to services like ChatGPT or Hugging Face's hosted models.
If you want to automate specific tasks (e.g., organizing documents, analyzing networks), it’s a great option because it’s lightweight and modular.
Bottom Line
What it is: A toolbox for building smart assistants that run locally.
What it isn’t: A fully autonomous, out-of-the-box AI.

It’s powerful for someone with your knowledge and setup, but it takes effort to make it work smoothly. Take your break, and when you’re ready, we can revisit this to plan how you might use it effectively. 😊






You said:
So what is the core insight huggingface has hit upon here given that they've had some time to observe the field and see how the ecosystems have developed. Is tool using agents "all you need"?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The core insight Hugging Face has hit upon with smolagents is that tool-using agents are a key component of practical AI systems, but they aren’t the whole story. Let’s unpack this:

1. The Role of Tool-Using Agents
Insight: Language models alone are limited in performing real-world tasks because they can't directly interact with the environment.
Example: A language model can describe how to scan a network, but it can’t actually do it unless paired with tools.
Solution: Smolagents bridges this gap by creating a framework where agents use predefined tools to act on instructions.
Tools = Functions that interact with the world (e.g., network scanners, file parsers, APIs).
2. Why This Insight Matters
Practical Utility: Most real-world applications require combining reasoning (LLMs) with actions (tools).
Example: Automating a task like "Find all devices on my network running nginx" involves:
Planning: The agent needs to break the task into steps.
Execution: Using tools to perform the steps.
Reasoning: Making sense of the results and presenting them.
Lightweight Modularity: Smolagents simplifies this by letting developers attach lightweight, task-specific tools to language models, instead of building monolithic AI systems.
3. Is This "All You Need"?
Not entirely. While tool-using agents are powerful, there are still challenges and gaps:

Strengths of Tool-Using Agents
Scalability:

You can add new tools as needed, making the system modular and extensible.
Example: Add a database query tool today, a file-processing tool tomorrow.
Customizability:

Highly specific workflows can be built, tailored to individual needs.
Example: A finance analyst can create tools to analyze spreadsheets and generate reports.
Data Privacy:

Running everything locally allows sensitive tasks to remain secure.
Limitations of Tool-Using Agents
Lack of Autonomy:

Agents don’t “learn” how to use tools dynamically. You have to define the tools and give clear instructions.
Fully autonomous agents that adapt to tasks and create new tools remain an open challenge.
Manual Effort:

Setting up and scaling workflows still requires significant human involvement.
Example: You need to define every tool, test them, and debug failures.
Task-Oriented, Not Goal-Oriented:

Smolagents excels at executing tasks, but it doesn’t reason about long-term goals or adapt strategies over time.
Limited Context and Memory:

Tools don’t naturally share state or context unless explicitly designed to do so.
Example: If a tool scans a network, the agent won’t automatically retain that information for future use unless programmed to.
How Hugging Face Observed These Trends
Hugging Face’s smolagents likely emerged from observing trends like:

LLM Augmentation:

People increasingly pair LLMs with external tools (e.g., using GPT with APIs or scripts).
Frameworks like LangChain and OpenAI’s plugin ecosystem already explore these ideas.
Shift from Pure NLP to Real-World Interaction:

Models are moving beyond text to interact with the real world (e.g., controlling robots, performing file operations).
The Need for Lightweight, Decentralized Solutions:

Not everyone has access to cloud infrastructure or wants to use it due to privacy, cost, or reliability concerns.
Is This the Whole Picture?
Tool-using agents are an important piece of the puzzle, but they aren’t “all you need.” Future systems will likely combine:

Dynamic Learning: Agents that can create, modify, and use tools on their own.
Memory Systems: Persistent, shared context across tasks and sessions (like ReAct frameworks or retrieval-augmented memory).
Goal-Oriented Reasoning: Agents capable of planning and optimizing toward long-term goals.
Collaboration: Multi-agent systems that work together and divide tasks intelligently.
How Does This Relate to You?
For someone like you, smolagents might be powerful because:

You have the skills and resources to define tools and tasks.
You can leverage its modularity to build workflows tailored to your needs.
However, it’s not fully autonomous—there’s still a lot of manual setup involved.
How to Improve on This
If you’re looking for something more autonomous or scalable, consider:

Tool Generalization:
Agents that discover and figure out tools on their own.
Task Memory:
Persistent memory across tasks to improve efficiency and reduce manual reconfiguration.
Meta-Agents:
A controller agent that dynamically assigns tasks to specialized sub-agents.
Bottom Line
Tool-using agents are a critical step forward, but they’re not the endgame. They work well for task-based automation and modularity, but achieving true autonomy and scalability will require the integration of dynamic learning, memory, and goal-directed behavior.






You said:
So is the fundamental limitation here related to the types of tools which can be deployed? Are tools only related to like programs one could invoke from bash cli for example or...?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The fundamental limitation of smolagents isn’t necessarily the types of tools that can be deployed—it’s more about how tools are defined, discovered, and used. While tools can go far beyond simple bash CLI programs, their utility and flexibility depend on how you design and integrate them into the agent.

1. What Can a Tool Be?
A tool in smolagents is essentially any function or callable that the agent can invoke. This means tools can:

Be as simple as a Python function (e.g., calculate_sum(a, b)).
Wrap complex programs or scripts (e.g., call ffmpeg for video processing).
Interface with external systems (e.g., query a database or an API).
Perform local operations (e.g., file I/O, network scanning, data transformation).
Examples Beyond Bash CLI
Python Libraries:

A tool can leverage Python libraries like requests, pandas, or matplotlib.
Example: Fetching data from a URL.
python
Copy code
@tool
def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    import requests
    return requests.get(url).json()
Local Models:

Use tools to invoke locally hosted AI models for inference.
Example: Text summarization with a Hugging Face model.
python
Copy code
@tool
def summarize_text(text: str) -> str:
    from transformers import pipeline
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
    return summarizer(text, max_length=50, min_length=25, do_sample=False)[0]['summary_text']
Custom Python Scripts:

Tools can wrap any Python script or module.
Example: A tool that runs a script for data preprocessing.
python
Copy code
@tool
def preprocess_data(file_path: str) -> str:
    from my_preprocessing_module import preprocess
    return preprocess(file_path)
External APIs:

Tools can interact with APIs for external services.
Example: Querying weather data.
python
Copy code
@tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    import requests
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    response = requests.get(f"http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key={api_key}&q={city}")
    return response.json()
Hybrid Tools:

Combine Python and CLI calls within a single tool.
Example: A tool that uses nmap for network scanning but parses the results with Python.
python
Copy code
@tool
def scan_network(ip_range: str) -> str:
    import subprocess
    result = subprocess.check_output(["nmap", "-sn", ip_range])
    return result.decode("utf-8")
2. Fundamental Limitations
Static vs. Dynamic Tool Usage
Static: Tools must be explicitly defined ahead of time.

Limitation: The agent cannot "discover" new tools on its own.
Example: If you need a new tool to process images, you must manually define it and add it to the agent.
Dynamic: Ideally, agents would infer how to use or even build new tools dynamically.

Smolagents lacks this out-of-the-box. It’s up to the developer to expand the toolset.
Tool Scope and Complexity
Tools can interact with almost anything, but:
Simple Tools: Easy to define and maintain (e.g., file readers, simple calculators).
Complex Tools: Require more work to integrate (e.g., chaining multiple steps, interacting with hardware).
Tool Invocation Overhead
Each tool invocation introduces some latency, especially if tools involve heavy computation or external calls.
3. Are Tools Limited to CLI-Like Programs?
Not at all! Tools can:

Abstract Entire Workflows:

Example: A tool could automate a multi-step process, like ingesting data, cleaning it, and producing visualizations.
Be Event-Driven:

Instead of waiting for direct instructions, tools could trigger themselves based on events or conditions.
Simulate Systems:

Example: A tool that simulates a mathematical model or a physical system.
Perform Cross-Domain Tasks:

Example: A single tool could fetch data from an API, analyze it, and save results locally.
4. Improving Tool Capabilities
Dynamic Tool Discovery
Introduce a registry or database where agents can query available tools dynamically based on the task.
Example: Instead of hardcoding fetch_data(), the agent queries: "What tools can fetch data from a URL?"
Tool Chaining
Allow tools to chain outputs automatically.
Example: The result of fetch_data() is piped directly into summarize_text().
Auto-Generated Tools
Agents could auto-generate tools by interpreting Python scripts, bash commands, or APIs.
Example: "Write a tool to sort a CSV file" results in:
python
Copy code
@tool
def sort_csv(file_path: str) -> str:
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.sort_values(by=df.columns[0], inplace=True)
    output_path = file_path.replace(".csv", "_sorted.csv")
    df.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
    return output_path
Integration with OS-Level Automation
Tools could leverage cron jobs, system-level hooks, or other OS-level automation.
Example: Schedule tasks or monitor system metrics.
5. What’s the Real Limitation?
The real limitation is not the type of tools but:

How tools are managed (static vs. dynamic).
How tools interact with each other (chaining, shared context).
How easily the agent scales when the number of tools or task complexity increases.
In Summary
Tools in smolagents are not limited to CLI-like programs. They can be any Python function, API call, or complex hybrid workflow. The key limitation lies in the manual setup required and the lack of dynamic adaptability. Improving how tools are discovered, invoked, and connected would make tool-using agents even more powerful.

Perform local operations (e.g., file I/O, network scanning, data transformation).

So how would I as a human go about 'making' and/or discovering new tools and fit them within the syntax of the smolagents library?

Creating or discovering new tools and integrating them into the smolagents library requires a structured approach. Let’s break this down into two parts: how to make tools and how to discover tools, followed by fitting them into smolagents syntax.

1. Making New Tools
To create a tool, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the Purpose
What should the tool do?
Define the input it requires and the output it produces.
Example: A tool to sort a list of numbers takes a list as input and returns a sorted list.
Step 2: Write the Function
Write a Python function that encapsulates the desired functionality.
Example: A tool to fetch data from a URL.
python
Copy code
def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    """Fetches JSON data from a given URL."""
    import requests
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
Step 3: Annotate with @tool Decorator
Use the @tool decorator to register the function as a tool.
Example:
python
Copy code
from smolagents import tool

@tool
def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    """Fetches JSON data from a given URL."""
    import requests
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
Step 4: Test the Tool
Run the function standalone to verify its behavior.
Example:
bash
Copy code
python -c "from my_tools import fetch_data; print(fetch_data('https://api.example.com'))"
Step 5: Add to the Agent
Register the tool with your agent by including it in the agent's toolbox.
python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent

agent = CodeAgent(tools=[fetch_data], model=model, add_base_tools=True)
2. Discovering New Tools
If you’re unsure what tools to create, here’s how you can discover or identify them:

Step 1: Analyze Task Requirements
Break down the task into smaller, actionable steps.
Example Task: "Process a text file and generate a summary."
Subtasks:
Read the text file (read_file tool).
Summarize the content (summarize_text tool).
Step 2: Leverage Existing Libraries
Use Python’s extensive ecosystem to find libraries or functions that accomplish your goal.
Example: For summarization, use Hugging Face’s Transformers library.
Example Code:
python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

@tool
def summarize_text(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarizes text using a pre-trained model."""
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
    return summarizer(text, max_length=50, min_length=25, do_sample=False)[0]['summary_text']
Step 3: Adapt External Scripts or Tools
Wrap existing bash scripts or CLI tools as Python functions.
Example: A tool that calls ffmpeg for video processing.
python
Copy code
import subprocess

@tool
def convert_video(input_file: str, output_file: str) -> str:
    """Converts a video file to another format using ffmpeg."""
    subprocess.run(["ffmpeg", "-i", input_file, output_file])
    return f"Converted {input_file} to {output_file}"
Step 4: Explore APIs or Online Services
Discover external APIs that can extend functionality.
Example: Weather API.
python
Copy code
@tool
def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Fetches weather data for a given city."""
    import requests
    response = requests.get(f"http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=API_KEY&q={city}")
    return response.json()
Step 5: Identify System-Specific Tools
Look at system utilities or network operations you frequently use.
Example: A tool to scan the local network.
python
Copy code
from scapy.all import ARP, Ether, srp

@tool
def network_scanner(ip_range: str) -> list:
    """Scans the local network for active devices."""
    arp_request = ARP(pdst=ip_range)
    broadcast = Ether(dst="ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff")
    result = srp(broadcast / arp_request, timeout=3, verbose=0)[0]
    return [{"ip": recv.psrc, "mac": recv.hwsrc} for _, recv in result]
3. Fitting Tools into smolagents Syntax
Here’s how tools integrate into the smolagents framework:

Basic Structure
Tools are Python functions decorated with @tool.
Add them to the agent’s toolbox during initialization.
python
Copy code
from smolagents import CodeAgent, tool

@tool
def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
    """Returns a greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Initialize the agent with tools
agent = CodeAgent(tools=[say_hello], model=model, add_base_tools=True)

# Give the agent a task
agent.run("Greet John using the say_hello tool.")
Adding New Tools Dynamically
You can dynamically add tools to an agent’s toolbox:
python
Copy code
new_tool = fetch_data
agent.toolbox.add_tool(new_tool)
4. Best Practices
Name Tools Clearly: Ensure names reflect the tool’s purpose.
Document Tools: Use docstrings to describe what the tool does, its inputs, and outputs.
Test Tools Individually: Validate each tool in isolation to avoid debugging complexities later.
Modularize Tools: Group related tools into separate Python files for easier maintenance.
Summary
Make Tools by writing Python functions, annotating with @tool, and testing them.
Discover Tools by analyzing tasks, exploring libraries, adapting scripts, and leveraging APIs.
Integrate Tools into smolagents by adding them to the agent’s toolbox.
This modular approach ensures that the tools you create are reusable, scalable, and easy to adapt to new tasks. If you’d like to build some specific tools together, feel free to share your ideas!
