    A->>+B: Generates code and output
    B-->>-A: Analyzes output for errors or feedback
    A->>+C: Monitors outputs to ensure alignment with project parameters
    C-->>-A: Checks if outputs in last ten prompts are related to expected deliverable
    A->>+D: Restarts process or reverts to last known good checkpoint
    D-->>-A: Monitors C's truncated output and ensures proper functioning
    A->>+Target_Server: Connects to the development environment for collaboration and task execution
    B->>+Target_Server: Reasons about output generated by A
    C->>+Target_Server: Monitors outputs of A and ensures alignment with project parameters
    D->>+Target_Server: Restarts process or reverts to last known good checkpoint
    A->>+Target_Server: Collaborates and executes tasks related to software development or other projects
    B->>+Target_Server: Analyzes compiler errors or other feedback from development environment
    C->>+Target_Server: Monitors outputs of A and B to maintain effective and dynamic development process
