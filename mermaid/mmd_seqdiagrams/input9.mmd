    A->>+B: Generates code and sends output
    B-->>-A: Analyzes output, returns error analysis or feedback

    A->>+C: Sends output for task alignment check
    C-->>-A: Confirms if outputs align with project parameters

    A->>+D: Requests process management
    D-->>-A: Restarts process or reverts to last known good checkpoint

    A->>+TS: Connects to server, executes development tasks
    B->>+TS: Analyzes and reasons about output from A
    C->>+TS: Ensures A's outputs align with project parameters
    D->>+TS: Manages workflow, avoids roadblocks, maintains efficiency
