    A->>+B: Generates code output, which is analyzed by the Code Analyzer for errors and alignment with project parameters.
    B-->>-A: Analyzes output. If it finds an error or misalignment, it sends back detailed feedback to A.

    B->>+C: Confirms if outputs align with project parameters.
    C-->>-B: Monitors all tasks that are in progress on the TS and ensures they're aligned correctly based on B's analysis.
    
    A->>+C: Sends output for task alignment check, ensuring it meets required standards. 
    C-->>-A: If any issues arise or misalignment is detected by A/C/B together, C will monitor to correct them.

    D->>+B: Requests process management.
    D-->A: If B identifies a roadblock in the workflow for task completion (like waiting on resource allocation), D would restart processes as needed.
    
    D->>C: If any issues or errors arise during execution of tasks, reverts to previous checkpoints ensuring data integrity and continuity.  
   
    A->>+TS: Connects to the server, executes development tasks.
    B->>+TS: Analyzes code output generated by A for accuracy before sending it back.
    
    C->>+TS: Ensures all outputs from A are aligned with the project parameters based on B's analysis. 
   
    D->>+TS: Manages workflow optimizations, avoiding roadblocks and maintaining efficiency of tasks.

    loop Health Monitoring
        D->>D: Monitors system health and performance continuously.
    end

    loop Dynamic Output Adjustment
        C->>C: Reviews outputs from A/B to identify any issues or errors. 
        D->>C: Adjusts processes based on feedback received by C, ensuring smooth execution of tasks.
    end

    loop Continuous Deployment
        A->>TS: Deploys code.
        B->>TS: Analyzes and reasons about output from A before sending back for deployment.
        C->>TS: Ensures continuous alignment with project parameters as new codes are deployed. 
        D->>TS: Optimizes workflow, avoids roadblocks, and ensures smooth integration of updates.
    end

    loop Adaptive Learning
        C->>C: Reviews outputs generated by A and B frequently to ensure high-quality code generation.
        D->>C: Uses feedback from C to improve process management strategies in real-time. 
    end

    loop Continuous Feedback Loop
        CF->>+UI: Users can provide feedback on performance and feature requests directly through the UI interface.
    end
    
    loop Monitoring and Logging (ML)
        ML->>SC: Logs all activities within the GRYPHGEN system for security audits.
    end
   
    loop Security and Compliance (SC) 
        SC->>DS: Ensures data storage is secure, encrypted with advanced encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access.
    end
